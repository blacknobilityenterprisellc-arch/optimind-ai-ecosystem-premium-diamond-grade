- Optimize existing project configurations
- Perform system upgrades or migrations

---

## **üìã 5-MINUTE QUICK START**

### **Step 1: Execute the Master Prompt**
Copy and paste the **MASTER_PROMPT_WORLD_CLASS_CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md** content into your AI assistant.

### **Step 2: Provide Context**
Tell the system:
```
"I need to replace my current project with a new project from this repository: [REPO_URL]
Current project: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]
Target project: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]"
```

### **Step 3: Execute & Monitor**
The system will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Analyze current project context
- ‚úÖ Clone and analyze target project
- ‚úÖ Plan migration strategy
- ‚úÖ Execute seamless replacement
- ‚úÖ Validate and optimize results

---

## **üîß DETAILED EXECUTION WORKFLOW**

### **PHASE 1: PREPARATION (2 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Review current project
ls -la
cat package.json

# 2. Note running processes
ps aux | grep -E "(node|next|tsx)" | grep -v grep

# 3. Prepare repository URL
# Example: https://github.com/username/project.git
```

### **PHASE 2: EXECUTION (10 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Kill running processes (system will do this automatically)
# 2. Backup current state (system will do this automatically)
# 3. Clone target repository (system will do this automatically)
# 4. Replace project files (system will do this automatically)
# 5. Validate results (system will do this automatically)
```

### **PHASE 3: VALIDATION (3 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Check project structure
ls -la

# 2. Verify package.json
cat package.json

# 3. Test basic functionality
npm run lint
npm run dev
```
