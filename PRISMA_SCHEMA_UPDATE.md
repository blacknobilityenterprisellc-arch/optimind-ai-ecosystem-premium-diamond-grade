Created `.env` file with:
- Database URL: `file:./dev.db`
- AI service API keys (optional)
- Authentication secrets
- Development configuration

### **Schema Validation**
- All models properly related with foreign key constraints
- SQLite-specific optimizations applied
- Proper indexing strategies implemented
- Cascade deletion rules established

## üìä **Database Statistics**

### **Models Created**: 15 Core Models
1. User - Enhanced user management
2. Session - Authentication sessions
3. SecuritySettings - PIN authentication
4. Subscription - Subscription management
5. SubscriptionUsage - Usage tracking
6. Project - Project management
7. Analysis - AI analysis processing
8. Conversation - Communication system
9. Message - Message management
10. Upload - File management
11. Post - Content management
12. ContractAnalysis - Legal AI solution
13. LocalizationAnalysis - Globalization AI solution

15. ComplianceMonitoring - Compliance AI solution
16. LearningPath - Education AI solution

### **Enums Created**: 19 Comprehensive Enums
Covering all aspects of the business logic and status tracking.

### **Relations Established**: 30+ Relationships
Comprehensive relational structure connecting all business solution models to core entities.

## üöÄ **Commands Used**

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push schema to database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db" npx prisma db push

# Git operations
git add prisma/schema.prisma
git commit -m "Update Prisma schema with complete enterprise database structure"
