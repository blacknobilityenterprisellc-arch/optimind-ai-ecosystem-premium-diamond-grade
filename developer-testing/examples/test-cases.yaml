        input:
          prompt: "Write a Python function that implements bubble sort algorithm and explain how it works."
          context: "programming"
          language: "python"
        expected_output:
          response: |
            Here's a Python function that implements the bubble sort algorithm:

            ```python
            def bubble_sort(arr):
                n = len(arr)
                for i in range(n):
                    for j in range(0, n-i-1):
                        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                            arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                return arr

            # Example usage:
            arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
            sorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)
            print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
            ```

            **How bubble sort works:**
            1. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list
            2. It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order
            3. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted
            4. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list
            5. Time complexity: O(nÂ²) in worst and average cases, O(n) in best case
            6. Space complexity: O(1) as it sorts in place

            **Key characteristics:**
            - Simple to understand and implement
            - Not efficient for large datasets
            - Stable sorting algorithm
            - In-place sorting (requires minimal additional memory)
          reasoning: "This tests code generation ability, algorithmic understanding, and explanation skills."
