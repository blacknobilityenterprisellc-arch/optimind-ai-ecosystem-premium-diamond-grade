## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Predictive Task Assignment

Use historical performance data to predict optimal task assignments:

```typescript
function predictTaskSuccess(agent, task) {
  const capabilityMatch = calculateCapabilityMatch(agent, task);
  const historicalPerformance = agent.performance.successRate;
  const currentLoad = 1 - agent.state.cognitiveLoad;
  
  return capabilityMatch * historicalPerformance * currentLoad;
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Resource Allocation

Automatically adjust resource allocation based on system demands:

```typescript
function optimizeResourceAllocation(agents) {
  agents.forEach(agent => {
    if (agent.resources.cpu > 0.8) {
      // Scale down non-critical tasks
      agent.tasks.active = Math.max(1, agent.tasks.active - 1);
    }
    
    if (agent.state.cognitiveLoad > 0.7) {
      // Activate learning mode during idle periods
      if (agent.state.status === 'idle') {
        agent.state.status = 'learning';
      }
    }
  });
}
```

### 3. Emergent Intelligence

Leverage collaborative intelligence for complex problem-solving:

```typescript
function createEmergentIntelligence(agents) {
  const collaboration = {
    participants: agents.slice(0, 3),
    synergy: calculateSynergy(agents),
    emergentProperties: generateEmergentProperties(agents)
  };
  
  return collaboration;
}
```
