    const baseWeight = this.config.baseWeights[modelName] || 0.25;
    const performanceMultiplier = totalPerformance > 0 
      ? (performance.reliability / totalPerformance) * this.modelPerformance.size 
      : 1;
    
    let adaptiveWeight = baseWeight * performanceMultiplier;
    adaptiveWeight = Math.max(this.config.minWeight,
